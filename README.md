# Speech_Signal_Analysis

Team: Nicholas, Maria, Raquel, Thalia

In this Practice Project, we utilized C++ to analyze given to data to calculate the average power, average magnitude, mean, standard deviation, variance, and zero crossings. The data "two_a.txt" reresented a specific person's speech signals while "two_b.txt" represents speech signals of a person who may or may not be the same person found in the "two_a.txt" data sample. The analysis consisted of reading and caluclating the data to determine if these two speech signals matched up to the same person. The results were computed and stored in the data file "comparison.txt".
